nbody
=====

n-body simulations of the solar system

basic2bodies
------------

A simple first order simulation, currently n = 2 but the aim is to build it such than n can be increased.

* to do
	* fix orbit simulation (partially completed, need to verify sun movements)
	* optimise time step
	* visualise

1stordernbody
-------------

Same code as basic2bodies but with Jupiter added
* to do
	* add Jupiter
	* check energy conservation calculations
	* visualise

2ndordernbody
-------------

Change algorithm to kick drift kick (2nd order approximation)
*to do
	* everything
